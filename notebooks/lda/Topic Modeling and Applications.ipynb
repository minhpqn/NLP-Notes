    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we introduce how to use LDA libraries to estimate topic models on data and how to use topic distributions as representations of documents in text classification and text clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Topic Modeling Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Acknowledgement**: Content of this section is credited by [Dr. Le Hong Phuong](http://mim.hus.vnu.edu.vn/phuonglh/).\n",
    "\n",
    "A topic model is a type of statistical model for discovering the abstract\n",
    "topics that occur in a collection of documents. Each topic can be viewed as\n",
    "a distribution of words (a unigram language model). Intuitively, given that a\n",
    "document is about a particular topic, one would expect particular words to\n",
    "appear in the document more or less frequently: ```dog``` and ```bone``` will app\\\n",
    "ear more often in documents about ```dogs```, ```cat``` and ```meow``` will appea\\\n",
    "r in documents about cats, and the and is will appear equally in both. A document\\\n",
    " typically concerns multiple topics in different proportions; thus, in a document\\\n",
    " that is 10% about cats and 90% about dogs, there would probably be about 9 times\\\n",
    " more dog words than cat words. A topic model captures this intuition\n",
    "in a mathematical framework, which allows examining a set of documents and discov\\\n",
    "ering, based on the statistics of the words in each, what the topics might be and\\\n",
    " what each document’s balance of topics is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic modelling is widely used in text mining and has many applications.\n",
    "In the lecture, you have learned some topic models, including latent semantic ind\\\n",
    "exing (LSI), probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) and latent\n",
    "Dirichlet allocation (LDA).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Topic Modeling Toolkits\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many implementations of LDA for topic modeling. In the tutorial, we try ```lda-c``` of David Blei and ```gensim``` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a longer list of LDA implementation see the article on Wikipedia: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Get Your Hands Dirty\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we used the sample data that contains 2246 documents from the Associated Press on the homepage of Proff David Blei. Download the data from [http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/lda-c/ap.tgz](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/lda-c/ap.tgz). On \\*nix environment, you may use the tool wget. After downloading, you need to uncompress the data into the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "tar xvfz ap.tgz\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The data file ```ap/ap.dat``` was converted into LDA format from original documents. The data format is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[M] [term_1]:[count] [term_2]:[count] ...  [term_N]:[count]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where [M] is the number of unique terms in the document, and the [count] associated with each term is how many times that term appeared in the document. Note that [term_1] is an integer which indexes the term; it is not a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information, you may want to read the instruction in [```readme.txt```](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/lda-c/readme.txt) within the lda-c-dist directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LDA-C\n",
    "\n",
    "lda-c is a C implementation of variational EM for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a topic model for text or other discrete data. LDA is fully described in [Blei et al. (2003)](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/papers/BleiNgJordan2003.pdf).\n",

    "### Gensim\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use Gensim - a Python library for Topic Modeling. You can install Gensim by using conda or pip. See [https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/install.html](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/install.html)\n",

This determines how ‘smooth’ the model is, which makes no damned sense if you aren’t working in the area (it doesn’t make much sense to me). Here’s what alpha does: as it gets smaller, each document is going to be more specific, i.e., likely to only made up of a few topics. As it gets bigger, a document can begin to appear in multiple topics, which is what we want. It’s not good to have a large alpha either, because then all our topics will start intermingling and making out and that’s gross.\n",

    "## Applications of Topic Modeling in Text Classification and Text Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will learn how we can use topic distributions of documents as new representations for the text classification task and compare with the **BOW** representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use [the 20 Newsgroups data set](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/) for this tutorial. The data set is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is to train a topic model on the training portion of the data. We will get the distribution over words for documents in the training data. We use the new representations to train a classification model on the training data. In testing, we used the generated topic model to infer topic distributions, and used the trained classifier to predict the labels for documents in test data.\n",

    "### Data Set\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the python library [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/about.html) to fetch 20newsgroups data. Since it takes time to train LDA model from all documents in the data, we just use a subset of categories."
